# The WBlower App

 Track 2 is to decode ways to reduce or prevent human trafficking through the use of technology, create awareness on human trafficking and sex labor.  

WBlower or Whistle Blower App is one of the concepts we came up with during the course of the hackathon

## The Idea

We believe human trafficking is not a one man thing and since there are often  bystanders at the scene, we came up with Wblower app : a simple mobile/web app that can be used to track and arrest traffickers around the world. 

With a robust reward system for people who report this act, onlookers can use their smartphones to take pictures of such scenes, upload either through the  Wblower  web app or mobile app.  The geo-location coordinates are  sent to the backend  along with the pictures which can be used to trace and finally nab the suspects.

Uploaded pictures can be processed using image processing technologies and then compared with known pictures of places from booking.com API.
